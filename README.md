This project is a exercise to put into practice the various html skills I will have learnt throughout the Odin Project thus far.

That means I will use basic html boilerplate for doctype, html, head, body. I will create a title, and set the charset to UTF-8
I will create headers, paragraphs, use bold and italic text, create images and links, and follow good practices for each throughout.
